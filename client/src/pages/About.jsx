      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, 
        making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, 
        to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. 
        The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

        <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
          making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
          looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
          and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
          <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
            as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
